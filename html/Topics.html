This experiment demonstrated that white light is composed of multiple colors, leading to the development of the field of optics. Isaac Newton’s work not only enhanced the understanding of light but also paved the way for further studies in color theory and the behavior of light.

He proposed that light can be thought of as being made up of packets of energy called photons. In his analysis, he explained that when light of a certain frequency shines on a metal surface, it can eject electrons from that surface. This experiment provided evidence for the particle nature of light and helped establish the concept of quantization in physics, which is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.

He used a torsion balance, which consisted of a horizontal bar suspended by a thin wire with lead spheres attached to each end. By observing the tiny angular displacement of the bar caused by the gravitational attraction between the spheres, Henry Cavendish was able to determine the density of the Earth. This experiment was one of the first to quantitatively measure gravitational forces and provided critical data for the law of universal gravitation proposed by <span><a href="scientists.html#IsaacNewton" class="unique">Isaac Newton</a></span> .

He sprayed tiny oil droplets into a chamber and used an electric field to balance the gravitational force acting on the droplets. By adjusting the electric field, Robert Millikan was able to calculate the charge of individual droplets and ultimately determined that the charge of an electron is approximately 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. This experiment was significant in confirming the quantization of electric charge and solidified the understanding of atomic structure.
